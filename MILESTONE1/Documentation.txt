--Week 1: Dataset Collection & Image Analysis::::

1. Scanned Document Dataset Overview
For this project, a dataset of 700+ scanned document images was collected using multiple scanner devices.
All images were scanned at 300 DPI, which is considered a high-resolution standard and preserves fine scanner-specific noise patterns useful for device identification.

The dataset consists of 3 different scanner brands/models:
HP
Canon
Epson

Each image is stored in TIFF (.tif) format, which is a lossless imaging standard.
TIFF retains:

Original pixel values
Fine-grain noise patterns
Scanner illumination and texture artifacts.


2. Dataset Labeling
Each scanned document was properly labeled with:
Scanner brand/model (e.g., hp, canon, epson)

File name
Directory structure mapping

| Image Path        | Brand |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| .\Canon\s2_25.tif | canon |
| .\Epson\s8_47.tif | epson |
| .\Hp\s11_3.tif    | hp    |

3. Basic Image Property Analysis
Before preprocessing, each TIFF image was analyzed for:

Resolution (pixels): e.g., 2480 × 3508 (typical A4 at 300 DPI)
DPI (Dots Per Inch): Confirmed to be 300 DPI
Format: All images in .tif format
Color channels: Many TIFFs are in RGB, some in grayscale
Bit-depth: Usually 8-bit per channel.

--Week 2: Image Preprocessing & Dataset Structuring::::

1. Image Resizing
To prepare the dataset for machine learning, all images were resized to a fixed dimension (224×224).

2. Grayscale Conversion
All images were converted to grayscale to simplify training.
Grayscale reduces input channels from 3 → 1, improving:
Model efficiency
Learning focus

3. Dataset Structuring
Final preprocessed images were:
Converted into NumPy arrays
Reshaped into consistent dimensions: (224, 224, 1)
Stored in arrays X (images) and y (labels)
